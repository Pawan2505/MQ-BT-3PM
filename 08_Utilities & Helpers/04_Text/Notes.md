### **Introduction to Text Utilities in Bootstrap**

In web design, the way text is styled plays a critical role in improving readability and enhancing the user experience. **Bootstrap**, a popular front-end framework, offers several text utilities to control the appearance and behavior of text elements on a webpage.

These utilities provide ready-to-use classes that allow you to adjust text alignment, color, transformation, spacing, weight, and more, all without writing custom CSS.

In this lecture Notes, we will explore the various **text utilities** that Bootstrap provides, helping you quickly and efficiently style text in your projects.

### **1. Text Alignment**

Text alignment determines how text is positioned within its container. You can control the alignment of text horizontally using the following Bootstrap utility classes:

- **`text-left`**: Aligns text to the left.
- **`text-center`**: Aligns text to the center.
- **`text-right`**: Aligns text to the right.
- **`text-justify`**: Justifies the text, spreading it across the full width of the container.

#### Example:

```html
<div class="text-left">
  This text is aligned to the left.
</div>

<div class="text-center">
  This text is centered.
</div>

<div class="text-right">
  This text is aligned to the right.
</div>

<div class="text-justify">
  This text is justified. It will spread across the full width of the container.
</div>
```

### **2. Text Color**

Bootstrap provides a set of text color utilities that you can use to quickly change the color of text.

Here are some of the most commonly used classes:
- **`text-primary`**: Applies the primary color.
- **`text-secondary`**: Applies the secondary color.
- **`text-success`**: Applies a green color, often used for success messages.
- **`text-danger`**: Applies a red color, typically for error messages.
- **`text-warning`**: Applies a yellow color, often used for warnings.
- **`text-info`**: Applies a blue color, often used for informational messages.
- **`text-light`**: Applies a light color (usually white or light gray).
- **`text-dark`**: Applies a dark color (usually black or dark gray).
- **`text-muted`**: Applies a muted color (gray).
- **`text-white`**: Applies a white color.
- **`text-black-50`**: Applies black color with 50% opacity.

#### Example:

```html
<div class="text-primary">
  This text is primary color.
</div>

<div class="text-danger">
  This text is red, often used for error messages.
</div>

<div class="text-muted">
  This text is muted, used for secondary content.
</div>
```

### **3. Text Transformation**

Text transformation allows you to control the case of text. You can change the text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize the first letter of each word using Bootstrap’s text transformation utilities:

- **`text-uppercase`**: Transforms the text to uppercase.
- **`text-lowercase`**: Transforms the text to lowercase.
- **`text-capitalize`**: Capitalizes the first letter of each word.

#### Example:

```html
<p class="text-uppercase">this text is in uppercase.</p>
<p class="text-lowercase">THIS TEXT IS IN LOWERCASE.</p>
<p class="text-capitalize">this text will have capitalized words.</p>
```

### **4. Font Weight**

The **font weight** utility classes control the thickness of the text. Bootstrap provides several classes to adjust the font weight:

- **`font-weight-light`**: Makes the text lighter.
- **`font-weight-normal`**: Sets the text to normal weight (default).
- **`font-weight-bold`**: Makes the text bold.

#### Example:

```html
<p class="font-weight-light">This text is light.</p>
<p class="font-weight-normal">This text is normal weight.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold">This text is bold.</p>
```

### **5. Text Decoration**

Bootstrap provides utility classes for managing text decoration. You can easily add or remove underlines, strikethroughs, and other decorations.

- **`text-decoration-none`**: Removes any text decoration (like underlines).
- **`text-decoration-underline`**: Adds an underline to the text.
- **`text-decoration-line-through`**: Adds a strikethrough to the text.

#### Example:

```html
<p class="text-decoration-none">This text has no decoration.</p>
<p class="text-decoration-underline">This text is underlined.</p>
<p class="text-decoration-line-through">This text has a strikethrough.</p>
```

### **6. Text Alignment for Flexbox and Grid Layouts**

You can use the text alignment utilities in combination with Bootstrap’s **flexbox** and **grid** systems to align content in a more complex layout.

For example, to center text inside a flex container:

```html
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <p class="text-center">This text is centered inside the flex container.</p>
</div>
```

This example uses **`d-flex`** for a flex container and **`justify-content-center`** to center the text horizontally within that container.

### **7. Responsive Text Alignment**

You can also make text alignment responsive. Bootstrap provides the following classes to adjust the text alignment at different breakpoints:

- **`text-sm-left`**: Align text to the left on small screens.
- **`text-md-center`**: Align text to the center on medium screens.
- **`text-lg-right`**: Align text to the right on large screens.

#### Example:

```html
<p class="text-sm-left text-md-center text-lg-right">
  This text will align differently on different screen sizes.
</p>
```

---

### **8. Line Height and Spacing**

You can control the line height and spacing between lines of text with the following utilities:

- **`lh-1`**: Sets the line height to 1 (tightest).
- **`lh-sm`**: Sets the line height to a small value.
- **`lh-lg`**: Sets the line height to a larger value.

Additionally, **margin** and **padding** utilities can control the spacing between text and other elements.

```html
<p class="lh-1">This text has a tight line height.</p>
<p class="lh-lg">This text has a larger line height.</p>
```

### **9. Practical Examples**

#### **Example 1: Customizing Text for a Card**

Here’s how you can use text utilities to style the text inside a Bootstrap card:

```html
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <img src="..." class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title text-primary font-weight-bold">Card Title</h5>
    <p class="card-text text-muted">This is some example text inside a card.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this example:
- **`text-primary`** gives the card title a primary color.
- **`font-weight-bold`** makes the title bold.
- **`text-muted`** gives the text a muted color, perfect for secondary information.

#### **Example 2: Text with Background**

You can combine text utilities with background utilities for interesting effects:

```html
<div class="bg-dark text-white p-3">
  <h2 class="text-uppercase">Heading with Dark Background</h2>
  <p class="text-light">This is a paragraph with light text on a dark background.</p>
</div>
```

This example creates a dark background with white text and transforms the heading to uppercase.
